Bank Loan Eligibility Checker

A Java console-based Proof of Concept (POC) that evaluates preliminary loan eligibility using predefined business rules.

Overview

The Bank Loan Eligibility Checker collects applicant information and evaluates preliminary eligibility based on age, monthly income, employment type, work experience, existing loan obligations, credit score, and requested loan amount.

This project demonstrates fundamental Core Java concepts, conditional logic, and rule-based decision-making.

Features
Validates applicant age.
Checks the minimum monthly income.
Supports salaried and self-employed applicants.
Validates employment or business experience.
Checks existing monthly EMI obligations.
Evaluates the applicant's credit score.
Validates the requested loan amount.
Displays eligibility or rejection messages.
Technology Stack
Programming Language: Java
Application Type: Console-based application
Input Handling: Java Scanner class
IDE: Eclipse
Version Control: Git and GitHub
